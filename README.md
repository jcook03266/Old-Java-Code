# Old-Java-Code
Some old Java code I made during my time as an undergrad. Feel free to look around, fork, clone etc. This code will not be maintained and is currently archived.

## Snake Game

- Your classic game of snake. You can run the code by cloning this repo and creating a build configuration specific to that scope's entry point instance. Controls are set to the up, down, left, and right arrow keys respectively.

## Let's Draw

- A simple art board / drawing application in which you can save .png files of your masterpieces. This was originally going to have persistent export and importing functionality but I ran out of time for the assignment. Same thing as before for running this code, clone and configure build target and run.
